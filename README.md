# Gamma_LUT_Toggle
Makes a little button in the Fiji/ImageJ toolbar with a greek gamma symbol. When you click the button, it will apply a nondestructive gamma of 0.45 by remapping the LUT while maintaining the underlying pixel values. Clicking the button a second time will toggle the image back to the original linear LUT. Works with grayscale as well as single-color LUTs.
